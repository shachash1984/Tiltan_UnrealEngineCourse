CPP:
1. Create a "Weapon" class
with the following members:

class Weapon
{
public:
	Weapon();
	Weapon(std::string _name, unsigned int _damage, float _range, float _reloadTime ,unsigned int _ammo);
	virtual ~Weapon();
	virtual bool Shoot(); //returns true if there is a hit, ALSO, needs to print the weapon's members and their values

protected:
	std::string name;
	unsigned int damage;
	float range;
	float reloadTime;
	unsigned int ammo;
};

2. Create 3 concrete types deriving from weapon


3. Create a "SpaceShip" class 
with the following members

class SpaceShip
{
public:
	SpaceShip(std::string _name, std::vector<Weapon*> _weapons);
	~SpaceShip();
	void AddWeapon(Weapon& _weapon);
	void Shoot() // Calls the weapon's Shoot() function
	void FireEverythingWeGot(); //loops through all weapons and calls their shoot function
	
private:
	std::string name;
	std::vector<Weapon*> weapons;
	Weapon* currentWeapon;
};

4. In the "main()" function, create a spaceship and shoot all weapons

**Bonus** if you can find and implement a random mechanism to the shoot function
