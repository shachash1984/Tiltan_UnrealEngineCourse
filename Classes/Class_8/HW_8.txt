CPP:
	Real interview question (try not googling the answer)
	*Hint*: think which container best suites this problem
	
	
	Given an expression string exp, write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“, “}”, “(“, “)”, “[“, “]” are correct in the given expression.
	
	Example: 
	
	Input: exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}” 
	Output: Balanced
	Explanation: all the brackets are well-formed
	
	Input: exp = “[(])” 
	Output: Not Balanced 
	Explanation: 1 and 4 brackets are not balanced because 
	there is a closing ‘]’ before the closing ‘(‘
	
		
	function signature:
	
	bool is_balanced(std::string expression)
	{
		
	}
