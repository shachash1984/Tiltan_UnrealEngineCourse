CPP:
Continuing the HW of class 10: **Duplicate - do not override the old HW**

1. Create a new abstract class ISpaceVehicle
2. Make ISpaceVehicle the base class for Spaceship (Shoot Should be a "pure virtual" method) and overriden in ISpaceVehicle derived classes.
3. Create a new type that derives from ISpaceVehicle "SpaceShuttle"
4. SpaceShuttle can only have one weapon. it owns it with a unique_ptr and creates it in its constructor (std::make_unique())
5. In main, Create an instance of SpaceShuttle (does not matter which weapon you choose to create) and call the Shoot() method

** if you see other members that can be in the base abstract class you can write them in it**
